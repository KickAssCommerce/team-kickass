# We're hiring! 
- but not actually paying, except maybe in virtual kudos. 
Working with KickAss is a labor of love, it's a conviction. 
It's the urge to join our epic quest to make a mark on open source ecommerce in the years to come.
And since we're a small team everybody get's to be a lead! How cool is that.

## Lead Frontenders
You will take it upon yourself to make our system frontender friendly.
Should we be API based with our output? Implement some exotic templating engine? We need someone that advises, reviews community PRs regarding frontend and scours the internet for the best solutions to propose for this project.
But remember, even though you're not a Lead 'Something', you can still contribute a lot via PRs and feature requests / issues

## Lead test engineers
We think testing is awesome. And we’ve even started writing tests. But basically we pretty much suck at them. It’ll be your job not to write all the tests but to help others write them for their code. Make suggestions, review PRs, advise others… We want it all, Scrutinizer, Travis, integrations tests… you name it but we need someone with a lot more knowledge than we have to implement this.

## Lead philosophers
You're not a developer, or just not in the mood of writing code. But you do have grand visions, interesting ideas and like to moderate and lead discussions. Lead philosophers engage the community and respond the feature proposals. They review PRs on a meta level and are thought leaders in their respective domain motivating others to get involved.

## Lead technical writers
So documenting stuff is hard. Like really hard. But we need it and we could use some help with it.
Where to document, what format, what tech, how can we automate it (partially) etc etc. So many questions and we have absolutely no clue what we’re doing. 
So, are you some kind of documentation wizard? Or just good with it? Come and help us.

## Lead developers
You’re a great programmer ready to make your mark on something big. Join us and help out with writing core features, creating boilerplate code, introducing new features and refactoring old stuff.
